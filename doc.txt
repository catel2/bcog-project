'''
Welcome to BeatRun! This program aims to help combine runners' music preferences, height, and speed they want to run and match those to songs from our database. 
BeatRun will make a playlist with songs that fit based on the user criteria and songs' beats per minute (BPM).

Functions:
1. read_csv(file_path):
  Description: Reads the dataframe with the song data into the program.
  Arguments: file_path, which will be a path to the song data file

2. user_input():
  Description: Greets/instructs the user and then takes their music genre preference / height / speed information and returns it to the main function.
  Arguments: N/A

3. data_filter(genre, height, speed, song_df):
  Description: Filters through the data frame and selects the songs that fit each user constraint. Returns a dataframe of these songs to the main function.
  Arguments: genre/height/speed from the user_input() function and the song dataframe

4. final_playlist(playlist_df):
  Description: Returns the final list of songs from the data_filter() function back to the user with the song and artist name.
  Arguments: playlist dataframe from the data_filter() function

5. main():
  Description: Executes all of the functions
  Arguments: N/A

Example of Using These Functions:
Eve is a runner who likes country music, is 5'8", and wants to run at 6.3 mph.
BeatRun would load the song_df into read_csv() first to prepare the program. Then, user_input() would say hi to Eve and instruct her on how to 
respond to the following prompts. Eve would select country as her genre, 68 inches as her height, and 6.3 as the mph. 
user_input() would return that to the main function. data_filter() then would iterate through the song dataframe and use a conditional to select the 
songs that match Eve's inputs. final_playlist() would take these songs and list to Eve songs like "Dirt on my boots" by Jon Pardi and others from the
song list. The program would end here.
