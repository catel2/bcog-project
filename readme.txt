1. For my final project, I plan to create a program that helps runners make playlists that coordinate with their speed goals. The program will use a csv file with songs and analyze the data based on its BPM. The program will also take user input about aspects of the playlist to personalize the playlist for the user. 


2a. The first function will read the csv file into a dataframe.

 b. The second function will greet the user and ask them about their height (for stride length), genre of song that they're interested in (out of options), and how long they want to run for.

 c. The third function will take this information and match it to songs within the csv file based on math and song type.

 d. A fourth function will return a formatted version of the songs to the user.
