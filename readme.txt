1. For my final project, I plan to create a program that helps runners 
make playlists that coordinate their genre preferences with their speed goals. 
The program will use a csv file with songs and analyze the data based on the BPM and genre of the songs. 
The program will take user input about the user's stride length, genre preference, and speed to create the playlist. Additional stats about the playlist will also be provided (such as the average energy and loudness of the playlist). 


2a. The first function will read the csv file into a dataframe.

 b. The second function will greet the user and ask them about their height 
(for stride length), genre of song that they're interested in (out of options), 
and how long they want to run for.

 c. The third function will take this information and match it to songs within 
the csv file based on math and song type.

 d. A fourth function will return a formatted version of the songs to the user.
