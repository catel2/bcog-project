Reagan likes pop music and wants to run with a playlist that matches her speed.

BeatRun would first greet Reagan saying "Welcome to BeatRun! This program aims to help combine runners' music preferences, stride, and speed they want to run and match those to songs from our database. 
BeatRun will make a playlist with songs that fit based on the user criteria and songs' beats per minute (BPM)."

Reagan would then be prompted to input her genre of choice (where she would type "pop"), her stride (where she would type 2.5 because her stride length is 2.5 feet), and her speed preference (where she would type 5.4 for 5.4 mph). 

Reagan would receive a list of songs that match these requirements back formatted as such:
Here's your playlist!
Side to Side by Ariana Grande
brutal by Olivia Rodrigo
I Knew You Were Trouble by Taylor Swift
(and so on) 

Reagan would also receive a print statement that said the following:
The mean popularity of your playlist is 65. The mean danceability is 82, the mean energy is 40, and the mean loudness is 32. If you want to find more songs that fit your speed/stride, the mean tempo is 145 BPM. Thanks for using BeatRun!

A bar plot that showed the mean popularity, danceability, energy, and loudness would also pop up.
